# Solutions to Real and Complex Analysis
The solutions to Rudin's papa book. Author is studying himself whilst updating the solutions.

The author has studied chapter 1-3 and is solving the problems alone. The author does not claim, on any situation, of
the originality of any content in this solution manual. However it is nearly impossible to acknowledge every source of this
book.

The author will not update solutions following the thread in Rudin's book but will eventually put all solutions in order.

If you have any problems/difficulties in understanding or suggestion/correction to fulfill the proof contents, **please consider open a [Github issue](https://github.com/AstrickHarren/Solutions-to-Real-and-Complex-Analysis/issues)**. Highly appreciated!!
